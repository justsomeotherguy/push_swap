# push_swap
A 42 Cursus Project

## Objectives

The project requires students to receive an unsorted arrangement of numbers and sort them in ascending order with a limited set of instructions.

|  Instruction              |     Description                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   sa (swap a)             |     swap the first two elements at top of Stack A                   | 
|   sb (swap b)             |     swap the first two elements at top of Stack B                   |  
|   ss                      |     perform sa and sb simultaneously                                |
|   pa (push a)             |     take the first element of Stack B and place in top of Stack A   |
|                           |     do nothing if B is empty                                        |
|   pb (push b)             |     take the first element of Stack A and place in top of Stack B   |
|                           |     do nothing if A is empty                                        |
|   ra (rotate a)           |     move all elements up in Stack A                                 |
|   rb (rotate b)           |     move all elements up in Stack B                                 |
|   rr                      |     perform ra and rb simultaneously                                |
|   rra (reverse rotate a)  |     move all elements down in Stack A                               |
|   rrb (reverse rotate b)  |     move all elements down in Stack B                               |
|   rrr                     |     perform rra and rrb simultaneously                              |
